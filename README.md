# VMware Cloud Director Rest OpenAPI definitions

OpenAPI definitions for vCloud's Rest API.

These can be used to generate libraries for interacting with vCloud from any
mainstream programming langauge.

OpenAPI definitions are sometimes known by their previous name of Swagger
specifications.

[vCloud Director 10.2.2 Rest API](./35.2.json)

Other versions: see top level folder

In general, clients can be generated by running an
[openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) command
similar to:

```bash
openapi-generator generate -i 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccouzens/vcloud-rest-openapi/main/35.2.json' -g 'typescript-axios' -o 'src/vcloud-client'
```

## Background

This is a repository of OpenAPI definitions for vCloud's Rest API. They are
automatically generated from the public documentation to reduce human error,
reduce human effort and to make it easy to stay up-to date.

vCloud Director has an
[official](https://vdc-download.vmware.com/vmwb-repository/dcr-public/772aa4c5-7e61-4d80-8432-b8e0d821c969/2747ec83-6aef-4560-b1d1-55ed9adc4e73/vcd-openapi-docs.html)
[OpenAPI](https://github.com/vmware/vcd-api-schemas/blob/master/schemas/openapi/src/main/resources/schemas/vcloud-openapi-schemas.yaml),
but it contains little of the functionality of the
[Rest API](https://code.vmware.com/apis/1159/vmware-cloud-director).

[Some of the documentation](https://vdc-download.vmware.com/vmwb-repository/dcr-public/1b6cf07d-adb3-4dba-8c47-9c1c92b04857/241956dd-e128-4fcc-8131-bf66e1edd895/vcloud_sp_api_guide_30_0.pdf)
instructs the user to follow `link` attributes in the responses and not to
create `href`s manually. This is incompatible with OpenAPI and contradicts other
official documentation that lists out paths within the API. This definition uses
predefined paths.

## How the definitions are generated

VMware Cloud Director Rest API supports responses and requests as both JSON and
XML. But only XML is officially documented by VMWare. JSON is better suited for
OpenAPI and modern usage. The mapping from XML to JSON is predictable.

Types are documented by VMware in XSD (XML Schema Definition). XSD is a
complicated format. It supports lots of concepts and it has multiple ways of
expressing a single concept. There are edge cases where I've not yet
incorporated an XSD concept.

Each API version has a zip file containing documentation about it on the vmware
website. The zip file is downloaded and passed into a Rust program that extracts
various information like responses, requests and paths. This program then
generates a JSON OpenAPI definition.

If you find an issue, tell me about it using
[Github](https://github.com/ccouzens/vcloud-rest-openapi/issues) and I shall try
and address it.
